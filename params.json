The server is a WSGI application which can be run standalone or behind Apache with mod_wsgi.\r\n\r\nPico is basically a Remote Procedure Call (RPC) library for Python without any of the hassle usually associated with RPC. Literally add one line of code (``import pico``) to your Python module to turn it into a web service that is accessible through the Javascript (and Python) Pico client libararies.\r\n\r\nThe Pico protocal is very simple so it is also easy to communicate with Pico web services from other languages (e.g. Java, Objective-C for mobile applications). See the client.py for a reference implementation.\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/fergalwalsh/pico/wiki) for more information.\r\n","name":"Pico","google":"UA-34240929-1"}
