Pico is a very small web application framework for Python.

In a single (small) file it is a server, a Python libary and a Javascript library!

Pico allows you to write Python modules, classes and functions that can be imported and called directly from Javascript.

Pico is NOT a Python to Javascript compiler - Pico IS a bridge between server side Python and client side Javascript.
